As to the current system (First past the post)  a candidate who reaches a relative majority  no matter how small it is  is elected. Especially the liberal democrats have suffered from this rule  as their voter share was insufficient to obtain parliamentary seats.

On August 27  1988 President Fujimori dissolved the fund in order to pay the national debts. On January 22  2002  the constitutional court (Tribunal Constitucional  TC) ruled that the dissolution was unlawful. The value of litigation thereby amounted to 9.565 bn. (former) Soles. Thereupon former contributors collected 2.3 million signatures by March 22  2006 for a law on the restitution of these financial means  just after an attempt failed in the congress. 1 532 551 signatures were declared valid  whereby the quorum amounted to 1 529 821. This implies that not all have been certified. By "Resolución N. 1215-2006-JNE" the electoral authority (Jurado Nacional de Elecciones  JNE) declared on July 8  2006 that Art. 32 of the constitution excluded tax related issues from popular votes. However  the constitutional court ruled on September 3  2007 by judgment nr. 1078-2007-PA/TC that the issues at stake could not be considered as taxes in any way and that the holding of a popular vote was legal. Referring to Articles 32 and 142 the JNE still refused to schedule a date for the popular vote. On January 8  2008 the constitutional court substantiated its initial sentence by judgment Nr. 3283-2007-PA/TC and ordered the JNE to immediately schedule a date. If the government and parliament were to fulfill this demand on the other hand  a popular vote would become obsolete. After further court decisions  on October 7 the JNE finally scheduled the date for May 1  2009 by decisions Nr. 331-2008-JNE and 331-A-2008-JNE  but as government did not release any financial means for the popular vote  the JNE had to postpone it. On May 8  2009 it finally scheduled the vote together with the local elections for November 21  2010 but after parliament antedated the elections to October 3  the voting date was removed to the same day as well. The vote was not organized by the JNE but by "Ofícina Nacional de Procesos Electorales" (ONPE) and the ballot boxes were open from 8.00 until 16.00. On November 18  2010 the ONPE concluded the vote count  established the adoption of the proposal and published the final result on December 7  2010 by Resolution Nr. 4905-2010-JNE. The following day  the act was enforced by President García as Law Nr. 29625. Legislative initiative as to Art. 31  32  and 107 of the Constitution and Law Nr. 26300 on civil participation.

According to Art. 175 of the constitution  a popular vote is to be held if agreed on by 3/5 of the parliament  otherwise the holding of a popular vote is at the President's discretion. On March 4  2010 the national assembly abbreviated the waiting period for popular votes from 120 to 60 days; however this amendment became effective only after one year (Art. 67 par. 7). Desired date of the AKP would have been the 12th of July. On 22 March 2010  the AKP submitted the reform package to the national assembly  which rejected the article regarding the aggravation of banning of political parties  by not achieving the necessary  330 votes. In July 2008 the incumbent AKP was almost prohibited by the constitutional court. The rest of the reforms was adopted ni the final vote by 336:72 votes and President Gül signed the proposal on May 12. The supreme electoral authority (YSK) scheduled the date for the vote for September 12  the 30st anniversary of the military putsch of 1980. Two points have been declared void by the constitutional court deciding on a complaint issued by the oppositional party CHP and with referral to the "Eternity clause" of Art. 4.

If none of the candidates reaches the necessary majority in two voting rounds  new elections are set. This was the case in the elections of 5 April 2009 and 29 July 2009  when none of the parties (KP and AEI) reached 61 seats. In order to bring the blockade to an end the AEI  which has a simple majority of representatives intends to re-enforce the direct election of the President. As the AEI did not reach the necessary 2/3 majority for constitutional amendments  it refers to Art. 75 of the constitution  which subjects important questions on society and state to mandatory referenda. On 3 June 2010 President of the Parliament Ghimu announced a referendum and new elections to be held on 14 November 2010. On 18 June 2010 Parliament amended the electoral law in a way that now the simple majority of valid votes  with a minimal turnout of 33 3% (insteas of 60%) suffices. On 6 July 2010 the Constitutional Court approved of this approach  so that the following day the Parliament decided to codify the direct election of the President in Art. 78 and to subject this procedure to a popular vote according to Art. 75 of the Constitution. The legality of this revision is unclear as the AEI avoided to follow the procedure according to Art. 143 (6 months waiting period and 2/3 majority in the Parliament). Nevertheless the proposal failed as the necessary one-third threshold required for a ballot to be binding  was not reached.

Nevertheless President Tandja who was elected 1999 and reelected in 2004 intended to prolong his term of office. Moreover in article 49  the constitution even excludes constitutional amendments by presidential plebiscites. On 3 May 2009 Tandja announced his intentions but on 25 May the Constitutional Court declared the elaborated draft for the new constitution unlawful. The following day  Tandja dissolved the parliament so that new elections became due within 45 until 90 days. On 2 June he assigned a commission to elaborate a new draft  which he finally submitted to popular vote by decree. After a claim filed by the opposition  the Constitutional Court annulled the decree on 12 June for violation of article 49 and 135 of the constitution. Thereupon the electoral commission (CENI) set new elections for the dissolved parliament for 20 August  failing to also set a popular vote. Governing by special powers according to article 53 of the constitution  Tandja can enact whatsoever kind of decrees in case of 'imminence of the Republic'. Hence he dissolved the constitutional court and appointed a new one on 2 July  together with an electoral commission obedient to him.

Since the reeligibility failed in 2007 as 'Reforma Constitucional' held according to articles 342 - 346 and therefore could not be submitted anymore in the current legislative term  the attempt had to be made as 'Enmienda' of a single issue. The process can be initiated by 15% of the electorate (2 542 759) or by 30% of the national assembly (51 deputies). Due to time reasons Chávez party initiated the constitutional amendment itself by 146 of the 167 deputies on 10 December 2008. Additional 6 668 984 signatures have been collected by 15 January 2009 for supporting the attempt. The first reading of 18 December only approved the unlimited reelection of the President (article 230). Due to protests the national assembly amended its proposal in the second reading of 14 January 2009 in as far as all officials could be reelected unlimitedly:      Governors (art. 160)     Representatives of the single states (art. 162)     Local governors (art. 174)     Deputies of the national assembly (art. 192)     President (art. 230)  The proposal was submitted to the CNE on 16 January 2009 in order to set a popular vote within 30 days.

The 'Ley Especial de Convocatoria a la Asamblea Constituyente No. 3364' provides for:      225 members     Election on 2 July 2006  deliberations as from 6 August 2006     Term of a minimum half a year  maximum one whole year     Enactment of the constitution with 2/3 of attendants     Popular vote within 120 days     Popular vote only on the entire constitution with simple majority (article 26)     President has no right to veto  The governing MAS reached the absolute but not the 2/3 majority in the elections. Since the Summoning Law is unclear  the MAS intended to declare autonomous the constituent assembly by simple majority but the Corte Suprema decided differently on 25 January 2007. After a long time of dissagreement on the code of practice the fractions compromised on:      Absolute majority as a rule     2/3 majority in the final vote     Separate decisions on maximum 3 single articles  which contain a minimum of 1/3 counter votes concerning a proposal of an alternative draft     Commission decides with absolute majority     Article per article 2/3 majority until 2 July 2007     Articles without 2/3 majority are handed back to the consiliation commission     Separate popular votes if again no 2/3 majority in the plenum     Final vote with 2/3 majority in the plenum     Result of the popular vote held on 2 July 2006 is binding  Since the constituent assembly is runnning out of time the Congress prolongued its assignment on 3 August 2007 by 'Ley de Amplicación de la Asamblea Constituyente  No. 3728' :      Prolongation until 14 December 2007     Draft in globo by simple majority in the first reading     In case of disagreement the Commission enacts proposal of the majority as well as of the minority     Single articles by 2/3 of the attendants  rest of articles in a consiliation conference     Congress sets a popular votes for articles that did not reach 2/3 majority within 120 days  results are binding as 'Referéndum dirimidor'  Under the boycott of the opposition the MAS and its allies amended the agenda with 145:0 in as much as the constituent assembly was convening under military protection in Sucre. The following day he approved of the constitution in the first reading. Controversial were the reelection of the president  the limit for large-scale land holding and the number of chambers of the congress. In order to gain time the question on large-scale land holding (art. 398) was left unanswered. The second reading on article per article took place on 8 and 9 December 2007 under boycott of the opposition. Since there was a 'Referéndum dirimidor' the constituent assembly was able to decide with 2/3 instead of all attendants. The constitution has 411 articles and the congress now has to work out the question whether large-scale land holding starts as from 5 000 or as from 10 000 hectares. On 14 December 2007 the constitution was submitted to the congress but due to procedural mistakes concerning the deliberation the oppositional majority of the Senate wanted to hamper the vote. But the congress is obliged to set a vote within 30 days otherwise the president was obliged to do so by decree. It is unclear which regulation was to be applied. On 28 February 2008 the Congress enacted Laws No. 3835  3836  3837 by which he set the vote on large-scale land holding on the same day as the vote on the constitution. Further only the congress can set votes on autonomous departements. The opposition was hampered to enter the parliament building and was substituted by surrogate deputies. On 7 March 2008 and by Resolutions 013-2008 and 014-2008 the Corte Nacional Electoral (CNE)  postponed all popular votes for an indefinite period since there were no legal nor technical bases. Thereupon single departements held own autonomy votes on their own. After the successful vote on his term of office of 10 August 2008 President Morales set the vote and further elections for 7 December 2008. Law No. 3836 sufficed as legal base. But the CNE cancelled all ballots by Resolution 149-2008 on 1 September 2008 due to missing of legal bases and time limits. In a congress taking place on 20 October 2008 government and opposition agreed on a special law on the vote:      Summoning Law with 2/3 in both chambers (opposition must go along)     Voting date 25 January 2009     President Morales waives on a further reelection     General elections on 6 December 2009     ca. 100 amendments to the constitutional draft  The day after and likewise by 2/3 majority the congress enacted 'Ley Interpretativa de la Constitución Politica del Estado para habilitar al Honorable Congreso Nacional realizar ajustes al Proyecto de la nueva Constitución Politica de Estado  No. 3941' in order to interpret article 232 of the current constitution is as much as the congress may undertake small amendments to the draft of the constituent assembly. For the vote itself the congress additionally enacted 'Ley de Convocatoria a Referéndum Dirimidor del Artículo 398 y para refrendar el proyecto de Constitución  No. 3942. The official final result was announced by the CNE on 2 February 2009. The constitution entered into force on 7 February 2009.

Although President Sezers' term ended on 16 May  he remained in office until the election of his successor. The constitutional reforms suggested by Prime Minister Erdogan were adopted by Parliament by 376:1 on 11 May. At the same time Erdogan scheduled re-elections for 22 July. President Sezer vetoed against these reforms. On 31 May Parliament approved the reforms anew by 370:21. As they had now been approved by a 2/3 majority twice  Sezer could do nothing else but schedule a plebiscite because he opposed the reforms. After the Constitutional Court held the parliamentary deliberations were legal  the Electoral Body (YSK) scheduled the referendum date for 31 July. Previously Sezer had refused to shorten the waiting period for plebiscites from 120 to 45 days and for some reason the vote did not take place together with the elections.

Legal base is article 95 of the Constitution  which provides for an impeachment by popular vote in cases of severe breaches. The Referendum Law (3/2004) only provides for an impeachment if adopted by the majority of the electorate. Only the third approach was met with the approval of the Constitutional Court which approved that the majority of the submitted voting papers sufficed for an adoption. The impeachment was initiated by Parliament with a Board of Inquiry on 28 February  2007  which was mandated to investigate Basescu's administration. On 21 March Parliament amended the Referendum Law. Despite the advisory opinion of the Constitutional Court  which stated Basescu  was not guilty of serious misconducts  Parliament (in an assembly of both chambers) adopted Basescu's deposition on 19 April  with 322 to 108 votes and 10 abstentions. The following day this decision was approved by the Constitutional Court. Therefore the referendum had to take place within 30 days  while Basescu's assignments were taken on ad interim by the President of the Senate. As Parliament simultaneously amended the Election Law 370/2004 so much that a suspended President could not stand for re-election  Basescu decided not to withdraw from office but to await the result of the referendum. After the Constitutional Court  announced the official result on 23 May 2007  President Basescu immediately resumed his office.

Despite massive protests Congress approved of the vote on 13 February 2007 with 57 to 1 votes. As Correa's proposal to hold the referendum on 18 March was not feasible  the TSE formally scheduled it for 15 April. On 10 March Congress attempted to dismiss the TSE  which thereupon divested 57 representatives of their mandate and appointed surrogates. On 23 April the Tribunal Constitucional reinstated 51 of them to their offices.

This was founded on 4 February 2003. The 2003 Federal Constitution of Serbia and Montenegro provided in Article 60 for the possibility of each federate State to secede from the Union by referendum after a three year waiting period. In 2001 and 2002 the Government of Montenegro had tried unsuccessfully to launch a referendum on this issue. On 1 March 2006 the Government and opposition decided on a law on the holding of popular votes with 60 votes to 10. At the instigation of the EU the 'yes' quorum was set at 55% of the valid votes.

The Constitution of Kenya Review Commission Act 1997 was amended over and over until it received its final version in 2001:      It prohibited simple constitutional amendments according to article 47 of the Constitution     Regarding the future draft of the constitutional conference (National Constitution Conference  NCC)  Parliament could only approve or not     Controversial amendments had to be submitted to the VA  Between August and October 2000 the Kenya Constitutional Review Commission solicited opinions of all groups and organisations. New President Kibaki was elected in December 2000. The NCC  which was composed of 629 members from all civil and social groups  including all 222 deputies  was in session from 24 April 2003 (Bomas I). The Conference was extended twice until 19 March 2004 (Bomas II and III). The main controversial point was the distribution of power between the President  the Prime Minister and Parliament. The draft provided for the Prime Minister to be accountable to Parliament  though this draft was not adopted unanimously. On 9 March 2004 the Government intended to abolish this regulation by 'Constitution of Kenya (Amendment) Bill 2004' and 'Constitution of Kenya Review (Amendment) Bill 2004'  so as to enable Parliament to amend the Bomas-draft and to prove necessary a popular vote (Article 47 of the Constitution and Articles 27 and 28 of the 'Review Act'). In January 2004 an opposition group sued the NCC for not being representative for Kenya. On 25 March the Supreme Court decided with 2 votes to 1 to ratify a new constitution by popular vote. Neither Parliament nor the NCC had a mandate to do so. As a legal basis the Court determined article 47 in its current version. On 5 August 2004 Parliament unanimously adopted the Constitution of Kenya Review (Amendment) Bill (also called Consensus Bill):      Bomas-draft directly submitted to Parliament     Controversial parts can only be amended by Parliament with a 65% majority     Mandatory popular vote with simple majority     Attorney General to adjust the new Constitution and to forward it to the electoral commission  Due to uncertainty about the legality of certain articles  including articles 47 par. 2 and 54 par. 1  President Kibaki did not ratify the Constitution. In February 2005 he ratified an amended version  according to which Parliament could amend a draft with a simple majority. A Commission composed of supporters of the Government (Parliamentary Select Committee  PSC) proposed the amendment of seven chapters to Parliament  which were submitted to it as being controversial (Kilifi-Draft). Another nine chapters which were proposed by the PSC were not adopted by Parliament  as the PSC had exceeded its powers. On 21 July 2005 Parliament adopted the Constitution with 102 to 31 votes and handed it over to the Attorney General  who included the amendments into the Bomas draft and published the draft Constitution on 22 August 2005:      President to appoint and dismiss the Prime Minister (Bomas: Prime Minister is accountable to Parliament  while the President is merely ceremonially accountable)     One chamber parliament (Bomas: Bicameral parliament)     Two stage administration (Bomas: Four stage administration)  The Electoral Commission of Kenya  ECK was given 60 days to prepare the vote. With 3 votes to 0 the Supreme Court refused the oppositions last suit according to which the 'Consensus Act' was illegal. On 6 September 2005 the ECK decided on the date  questions and symbols:  "Are you for or against the ratification of the proposed new Constitution?" "Je  unakubali au unapinga kuidhinishwa kwa Katiba Mpya?"  A banana was the symbol for a 'yes' vote  an orange for a 'no' vote. The polling stations were open from 07:00 until 17:00.

It provided for the election of a National Assembly in 1 January 2005 which was made responsible for drafting a new constitution. Disagreement between the different ethnic groups concerning the distribution of power and revenue from oil between the provinces and the central State and the role of Islam caused a delay which forced the National Assembly to extend the given time limit. Finally on 18 September the Constitution was printed and handed over to the electorate. According to article 61C adoption required the approval of a simple majority of the electorate and a maximum rejection of more than 2/3 in two of the 18 provinces.

By Law 477 it held a consultative popular vote on 23 September 2004 on the question of whether the citizens favoured a uni-cameral or a bi-cameral system. If the majority of voters approved of the uni-cameral parliament a mandatory constitutional referendum was to be held on 9 July 2007 to accordingly amend the Constitution. According to chapter VII article 1 of the Constitution adoption required a 2/3 majority in each chamber. A submission was made by the Senators on 19 May 2006 which was approved by 18:8 but rejected by the House of Representatives by 21:28. Claims lodged by supporters of the uni-cameral system were dismissed by several courts  and then finally by the Supreme Court on 29 June 2007.

Article 88 (5): 'Tout projet de loi autorisant la ratification d'un traité relatif à l'adhésion d'un Etat à l'Union européenne et aux Communautés européennes est soumis au référendum par le Président de la République.

Previously dual citizenship had not been possible. Many Palauans worked in the USA and dual citizenship was important to them as it was linked with the right to land ownership.      Summary of proposed amendment:  The Constitution of the Republic of Palau currently does not allow Palauan citizens over the age of 21 to hold citizenship in any other nation. The proposed amendment  if adopted  will change the Constitution to allow Palauan citizens to become citizens of the United States and potentially other nations  if permitted by statute  without renouncing their Palauan citizenship.

Despite having the character of an impeachment  articles 71 till 74 are summarised as 'Referendo Popular'. Once half of the term of office to which an official has been elected has elapsed  a number of voters constituting at least 20% of the voters registered in the pertinent circumscription may extend a petition for the calling of a referendum to revoke such official's mandate. When a number of voters equal to or greater than the number of those who elected the official vote in favor of revocation  provided that a number of voters equal to or greater than 25% of the total number of registered voters have voted in the revocation election  the official's mandate shall be deemed revoked. Per term of office only one petition on revocation can be initiated. In July 2000 Chávez was elected with 3 757 773 votes. Hugo Chávez assumed office as president under the effective 1961 Constitution on 2 February 1999 for a 5 year term  and on 19 August 2000 for a second term of 6 years under the 1999 Constitution. In April 2001 the 'Sala Constitucional del Tribunal Supremo de Justicia' (TSJ) decided article 72 to be applied according to the new constitution and the 19 August 2003 as the earliest possible date for a recall. The given date is too late for the opposition which consequently collected approx. 2.7 million signatures in 'Firmazo' but did not submit them for the time being. Its intention was to bring about a consultative popular vote on issues of national importance according to article 71 which could be initiated by merely 1/10 of the electorate. Only on 19 August 2003 it submitted the signatures but on 12 September the TSJ decided that the signatures were invalid since they have been collected too early and for another purpose than the revocation.  On 26 September the Consejo Nacional Electoral (CNE) determined a schedule for the impeachment: two days for the examination of the proposal to hold a referendum  20 days for the preparations of the list of signatures  4 days for the collection of the signatures  30 days for their review and 97 days for the organisation of the popular vote. On 15 October it determined the collection period to start on 28 November and to last until 1 December 2003. On 19 December the opposition submitted 3 602 051 signatures which have been checked by the CNE between 14 January and 13 February 2004.  A preliminary result has been announced by the CNE on 2 March 2004:  Submitted		3'086'013Valid		1'832'493Definitely invalid	143'930 (Minors  aliens etc.)Invalid		233'573 (for other reasons)Dubious		876'017 (repairable vices of form)Missing		604'587 (out of the dubious)Quorum               	2'437'080  On 15 March the Sala Electoral of the TSJ decided the dubious signatures to be valid while the Sala Constitucional decided the contrary on 23 March. By agreement the initiators were granted the possibility to correct the invalid signatures between 28 to 30 May 2004. On 8 June the Junta Nacional Electoral (JNE) announced the recall proposal to be accomplished and the vote was scheduled for 15 August 2004.    On 15 June the CNE promulgated the ballot question:  '¿Está usted de acuerdo con dejar sin efecto el mandato popular otorgado mediante elecciones democráticas legítimas al ciudadano Hugo Rafael Chávez Frías como presidente de la República Bolivariana de Venezuela para el actual periodo presidencial? Se darán dos opciones de respuesta: 1) No y 2) Sí'  The question did not contain the expression 'revocar' as written in article 72: 'referendo para revocar su mandato'. In order to register new voters the voting register was opened until 10 July. On 30 July the CNE announced 14 245 615 voters to be registered. Thereof 14 037 900 are eligible to vote in the refeendum  excluding the 20 587 aliens. The numbers do not correspond: a difference of 128 remains.

The prince intended to hold the European Economic Area (EEA) referendum before Switzerland  while the government plead for holding it afterwards. Therefore the prince threatened to dismiss the government but the latter asserted itself. Finally the vote was held on 13 December  one week after the Swiss vote. Ever since the prince aimed for amending the constitution in his own favour and threatened to leave the country if that would not happen. As provided for by the new House law of 1993  that has been countersigned by the prime minister without decision of the Landtag (parliament)  women are still excluded from family powwow and succession to the throne. Further points of controversy were the amiguities in the constitution concerning the appointment of judges and officials. The prince had his constitutional proposals distributed nationwide as 'red' or 'green' booklets. After governmental elections in spring 2001  the Liberal Civil Party (FBP)  which is known as being faithful to the prince spelled the more critical Fatherland Union (VU). In autumn the prince then submitted his slightly modified proposal as government bill to the Landtag. In a first reading of 20 December 2001 his submittal raised a lot of criticism by the opposition. In spring 2002  the Landtag sent a commission to the prince in order to effect a compromise. The latter called for an anticipated warrant to get the necessary 3/4 majority before the second and third reading. For now  the negotiations and the compromise proposal remained privy. Nevertheless  the commission did not pledge the warrants  whereas the prince launched his 'constitutional draft of 27 June 2002'  including the modifications made beginning of August  as popular initiative. Contemporaneously a new group 'Constitutional peace' appeared  which proposed a compromise in a second popular initiative to not extend the prince's powers too much and at the same time the proposal intended to remove some ambiguities. On 24 October 2003 the Landtag rejected complaints arguing that the prince was not allowed to launch popular initiatives. The collection of the signatures for both initiatives took place from 1 November until 13 December 2002. While the prince's initiative achieved 6 240 valid signatures (37 2% of the electorate)  the Constitutional peace initiative achieved 2 199 valid signatures (13 1%). On 19 December the Landtag adopted the Prince's initiative by 13:12  while the FBP approved of it and the VU and Free list Party rejected it. The Landtag rejected the Constitutional peace initiative by 6:19. All complaints lodged against the prince's initiative have been disallowed by the Crown Court on 3 February 2003. The prince threatened to take up residency abroad  if his initiative be rejected and announced he would not approve of the Constitutional peace initiative if it would be adopted by popular vote. Empty and invalid ballot slips are not counted separately in the case of popular votes with tiebreak questions. In contrary to Switzerland  only those voters who voted with a double yes in regard to the two proposals may answer the tiebreak question.

The date was set by the government. While the Nationalists approved the holding of the vote  the Social Democrats opposed it. The day after the vote Prime Minister Fenech Adami called for new elections to be held on 12 April. Would the election have been won by the Social Democrats  they would not have signed the accession treaty because accession to the EU was been approved by the majority of the electorate. Finally the Nationalists won the elections with almost the same result and Malta acceded to the EU. Parliament ratified the accession on 13 July. Malta was the first of the ten acceding states to hold a referendum on acceding to the EU and therefore became the 16th member state of the European Union.

The constitutional reform as a whole was submitted to a vote. Akayev also wanted to have his position in office confirmed.

During Sunday's vote  journalists had reported a low turn-out  following an opposition call for a boycott. Following the official announcement of the result by Moussa Solano  Territorial Administration and Security Minister  opposition parties reacted angrily to the results of the referendum on the presidency  saying it was a constitutional coup d'etat and a masquerade . On Independence Day (2 October)  President Conté suggested a constitutional reform and a few days after enacted a decree  setting a popular vote for 11 November. Thereby he disobeyed to Article 91 of the Constitution  which decrees the President to seek for the parliament's assent to the amendment before holding the plebiscite. The exact content of the revision was announced only a few days before the vote. In totally 8437 ballot boxes  white ballot papers were casted for yes and red ones for no votes. According to article 83 of the Constitution  the Supreme Court announced the official result on 28 November  whereby the result remains controversial as independent sources estimate the actual turnout to amount to 20%.      Main issues of the reform:       Addition to article 1: The seal and the coat of arms shall be codified by standing orders     Implementation of gender equality in Article 8     Abolition of the clause in article 24 restricting the term of office to 2 of 5 years     Abolition of the clause in article 26 restricting the age limit to 70 years of age     New wording of article 88 regarding the districts and the local collectivities     Article 89 regarding the supervision of the local administrations by the central government ,"State organisation | Political system | Constitution",91.28,3705422,98.36,1.64,yes,

In both chambers the absolute majority of votes was achieved (312 resp. 162 votes)  but not the 2/3 majority and therefore the reform was subject to an optional constitutional referendum  which could be launched within three months by 500 000 eligible voters  five members of the regional government or 1/10 of each chamber. 112 representatives of the Senate's right-wing parties launched a referendum on 13 March 2001 because they were opposed to the reform and 77 representatives of the parties on the left  because they did not want to subject the proposal to vote. On 22 March the Court of Cassation confirmed its accomplishment. Since the referendum was consultative (not binding)  there was no need for a 50% participatory quorum as is usually the case for the abrogative referendum. So far  all constitutional amendments achieved a 2/3 majority in both chambers  so this was the first possible optional constitutional referendum.

The Central Election Commission accepted the validity of the initiative on 15 January 2000 as they ruled that more than three million signatures had been collected  including at least 100 000 in more than 2/3 of provinces. The same day President Kuchma set the referendum for 16 April. Parliament deemed this referendum unconstitutional and in order to avoid it  it decided to file an appeal to the Constitutional Court. On 29 March  the Court decided the referendum was constitutional and must be held. The Court recognised that the two ballot questions concerning the dissmisal of the Parliament and the holding of a referendum on the entire constitution were unconstitutional and must be removed from the ballot papers. As the regulations of the 1996 Constitution and the 1991 Law on Referendum do not decree clearly whether the result of a popular vote is binding  the Constitutional Court decided on 7 April that the parliament must accept the decision as binding and conduct the amendment.           Ballot question 1:        'Do you support the proposal to add to Article 90 of the Ukrainian Constitution a new third paragraph containing the following: The President of Ukraine can also prematurely suspend the authority of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine if the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine fails to form a permanent parliamentary majority within a month  or if the Rada fails to approve  within three months  the State Budget of Ukraine prepared and submitted using the established procedure by the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine   and this paragraph would establish additional grounds for the President to dissolve the Verkhovna Rada; and respectively to add to point 8 of paragraph 1 of Article 106 of the Ukrainian Constitutions such words: and in other cases set forth by the Ukrainian Constitution?'

Portugal wanted to establish the legal basis. While the Fretilin (Frente Revolucionária do Timor-Leste Independente; major East Timorese party) strived for independency  the UDT (União Democrática Timorense; Timor Democratic Union) contended for accession to Indonesia. With Portugal's acquiescence  the military of Indonesia intervened in the conflict in September 1975. As the Fretilin declared the independence of East Timor on 28 November 1975  Indonesian troops occupied the whole region and appointed an interim government. By Resolutions 384 (1975-12-22) and 389 (1976-4-22)  the UN called for East Timor's right to self-determination. On 31 May 1976 the interim government decided on accession to Indonesia and Portugal protested unsuccessfully. After President Suharto's resignation in June 1998  the question appeared on the agenda once again. Initially Indonesia rejected a popular vote and offered a little autonomy instead. Portugal and Indonesia concluded a Treaty on 5 May 1999 under UN supervision  which provided for a popular vote in East TImor on the status of autonomy or on independence.  Due to the unstable situation the vote was postponed first from 8 August  to 22 August and then to 30 August. Of the total 451 792 enfranchised citizens  13 279 were living in Australia  Indonesia  Portugal  Mozambique  Macao or the USA. Those eligible were older than 17 years of age  born in East Timor  had at least one East Timorese parent or who was at the very least married to a person of East Timorese descent. The 850 ballot boxes were opened from 06:30 until 16:00. A total of 5 300 persons were employed for the voting day and the costs amounted to US$53 million. Only results of from Timor-Leste as a whole were available  there were no voting details from the individual districts.           Ballot question (English  Bahasa Indonesia  Portugese and Tetun):        "Do you accept the proposed special autonomy for East Timor within the unitary state of the Republic of Indonesia or do you reject the proposed special autonomy  leading to East Timor's separation from Indonesia?"  Together with the ballot question  the Indonesian flag was pictured as the first option for a national flag and the flag of the National Council of Timorese Resistance for the second option. The Consulting People's Assembly in Jakarta ratified the result on 19 October and East Timor obtained independence as Timor Lorosae on 20 May 2002.,"State organisation | National identity | none",0,438968,21.5,78.5,no,

The Treaty specified  as set down by Law 88-1028 of 9 November 1988  that a new referendum on independence from France must be held within ten years. In the Treaty of Nouméa on 5 May 1998 the two parties agreed that further powers were to be gradually conferred on the local authorities (parliament  government  citizenship). After the transitional period the question of independence could only be posed again from 2013. The French Parliament amended title XIII of the Constitution in such a way to enclose transitional provisions for New Caledonia:  By 31 December 1998 a referendum must be held on the Treaty of Nouméa according to the provisions of Law 88-1028. Those eligible to vote are essentially those who were eligible in 1988  as well as those who have been resident without interruption since that time.

Nevertheless Akayev arranged the vote on the package as a whole. Suggested package of amendments to the Constitution:      Introduce private ownership of land  with the proviso of a five-year moratorium on the sale and purchase of agricultural land      Strip Parliament of its right to discuss budgetary spending without government approval      Increase the number of deputies in the Legislative Assembly from 35 to 60 (with 15 members elected proportionally by party lists and the other 45 elected from single-mandate constituencies) and reduce the number of deputies in the People's Assembly from 70 to 45 (all elected from single-mandate constituencies)      Strip deputies of their right to immunity in some cases      Increase somewhat the freedom of Kyrgyzstan's independent media.  The referendum questions were offered as a package  making it impossible to vote on individual amendments.

More than 500 000 people signed this petition. President Michal Kovac had to announce a referendum within 30 days. During this time  Parliament also accepted a project for a referendum regarding the accession of the Slovak Republic to NATO with three questions. The President of the Republic decided to combine all four questions into one referendum:       Are you in favour of Slovakia's membership in NATO?     Are you in favour of the deployment of nuclear weapons on Slovak soil?     Are you in favour of establishing military bases in Slovakia?     Are you in favour of the direct election of the President of the Republic?  The Central Referendum Committee rejected the proposal of the Minister of the Interior about subjecting two ballot papers to the referendum: One paper with the three questions concerning NATO and the second one concerning the Presidential election. Finally 4 500 000 ballot papers with four questions were printed and distributed to the 79 districts of Slovakia. Nevertheless on 21 May the Minister of the Interior ordered the printing and distribution of another 4 500 000 papers with three questions and even cancelled the distribution of the previous 4 500 000 papers with four questions. As the Central Referendum Committee did not give permission to print the papers with only three questions  they were not official and therefore not valid for the referendum. All this lead to major chaos since people did not know whether the referendum would take place or not. While in some districts people were supposed to vote on the three-question papers  in others there were no papers at all as several local chairmen did not accept the three-question papers. Even where available  many voters refused to vote on the three-question papers when they saw those papers were not legal. According to official results only 9.8% of all voters participated in the referendum with the three-question papers. In the biggest district Bratislava-Petrzalka with more than 80 000 eligible citizens  they  had no papers at all. Participation on the legal papers with four questions amounted to 0%. Result: The referendum did not reach the necessary minimum participation rate of 50% and was therefore marred by the government.

Accessions to this kind of international organizations have to be approved by popular vote according to article 7 and article 93 of the constitution. On 13 March 1997  President Kovac scheduled the votes on all four submittals for the same date  so as to reach the turnout of 50%. The Central Electoral Committy had printed ballot papers containing all four questions. On 21 May  the Constitutional Court decided that the initiative was valid but not binding. Thus  it could not alter the decision of the president.

More than 500 000 people signed this petition. President Michal Kovac had to announce a referendum within 30 days. During this time  Parliament also accepted a project for a referendum regarding the accession of the Slovak Republic to NATO with three questions. The President of the Republic decided to combine all four questions into one referendum:       Are you in favour of Slovakia's membership in NATO?     Are you in favour of the deployment of nuclear weapons on Slovak soil?     Are you in favour of establishing military bases in Slovakia?     Are you in favour of the direct election of the President of the Republic?  The Central Referendum Committee rejected the proposal of the Minister of the Interior about subjecting two ballot papers to the referendum: One paper with the three questions concerning NATO and the second one concerning the Presidential election. Finally 4 500 000 ballot papers with four questions were printed and distributed to the 79 districts of Slovakia. Nevertheless on 21 May the Minister of the Interior ordered the printing and distribution of another 4 500 000 papers with three questions and even cancelled the distribution of the previous 4 500 000 papers with four questions. Since the Central Referendum Committee did not give permission to print the papers with only three questions  they were not official and therefore not valid for the referendum. All this lead to major chaos as people did not know whether the referendum would take place or not. While in some districts people were supposed to vote on the three-question papers  in others there were no papers at all since several local chairmen did not accept the three-question papers. Even where available  many voters refused to vote on the three-question papers when they saw those papers were not legal. According to the official results only 9.8% of all voters participated in the referendum with the three-question papers. In the biggest district Bratislava-Petrzalka with more than 80 000 eligible citizens  they had no papers at all. Participation on the legal papers with four questions amounted to 0%.

Parliament insisted that the decree only applied to the vote concerning the Day of the Republic  the vote on the direct election of local authorities. On 15 November the President sacked the Head of the Electoral Commission and on 27 November  following the plebiscite  he dissolved Parliament and ignored the decision of the Constitutional Court  a part of which stepped down shortly after.

In addition  many of the powers previously invested in the Supreme Soviet were to be transferred to the President. These included the right to appoint the Supreme Court  the Supreme Economic Court  the Chairman and members of the board of the Central Bank  the Prosecutor General  the Chairman of the Constitutional Court and the Chairman of the Central Commission for Elections and Referendums. Whereas previously the Supreme Council appointed all members of both the Constitutional Court and the Central Commission for Elections and Referendums  Lukashenko?s proposals envisaged that six members of both bodies (in addition to the chairman) be appointed by the President and six by the Council of the Republic. The new presidential powers would also include the right to call national referendums as well as elections of parliament and local councils. According to the amendments proposed by the President  if parliament twice rejected his choice of Prime Minister the President would have the right to dissolve parliament and impose an acting Prime Minister as he saw fit. Finally a transitional clause was added allowing the President to serve a full five-year term from the date the new constitutional amendments were passed  effectively extending his first term of office from five to seven years.

The opposition protested to the Constitutional Court but the Court decided on 23 February 1995 that Berisha had acted according to article 3(2) of the interim constitution  by virtue of which the people or Parliament have to decide directly. Main points of contention were the competencies of the President and the fact that religious leaders had to have lived in the country for at least 20 years. The consequence would have been a mandatory constitutional referendum according to article 130.,"State organisation | Political system | Constitution",84.43,1602875,43.62,56.38,no,

By decree Yeltsin dissolved the parliament on 21 September 1993  had it occupied by troops on 3 October and thereby violated article 106 par. 2 of the former constitution. From then on he ruled by decree and on 15 October he enacted a decree for a popular vote on the new constitution  which he assertively did not declare referendum but plebiscite since otherwise the adoption would have required the majority of the electorate (which would have been missed with an adoption of merely 31 02%). Now the participation of 50% of the electorate sufficed. Instead of marking the approved option the voters had to cross out the option they rejected. The text of the constitution was published only on 10 November. After the central electoral committee announced the final result on 24 December the constitution entered into force on 25 December 1993. The elections for the Duma of the same day were held on the new constitutional base.

Both sides agreed provisionally that Yeltsin should govern with special powers until the enactment of a new constitution in spring 1993. In the beginning of 1993 Yeltsin scheduled a popular vote for 11 April on the new constitution but in March the parliament amended the constitution in order to withdraw Yeltsin's powers. On 20 March the latter gave himself special authorities but on 28 March the impeachment of the parliament failed due to the 2/3 threshold. On 29 March the parliament elaborated 4 own questions and determined that the adoption required the majority of the electorate. President Yeltsin called for the majority of valid votes since the questions concerned amendments to the constitution. On 21 April the constitutional court decided that the adoption of questions 1 and 2 required a majority of valid votes as well as a turnout of 50% of the electorate and the adoption of questions 3 and 4 required a majority of the electorate since the abbrevation of term implied a constitutional amedment.

Only on 2 June 1988 the constitutional convention passed a transitory provision by 495:23 and 11 abstentions  which scheduled a popular vote on the form of state and government for 7 September 1993. A subsequent constitutional amendment brought the vote forward to 21 April. Voting was compulsory.  Disposições Constitucionais Transitórias 2: "No dia 07 de setembro de 1993 o eleitorado definirá  através de plebiscito  a forma (rep 'ublica ou monarquia constitucional) e o sistema de governo (parlamentarismo ou presidencialismo) que devem vigorar no País." Initially  the parliament intended to submit only one single question to the ballot with the three options Monarchy  Presidential Republic and Parliamentary Republic. But finally it decided to submit two separate questions: one on the form of state and the other on the form of government.

Only on 2 June 1988 the constitutional convention passed a transitory provision by 495:23 and 11 abstentions  which scheduled a popular vote on the form of state and government for 7 September 1993. A subsequent constitutional amendment brought the vote forward to 21 April. Voting was compulsory.  Disposições Constitucionais Transitórias 2: "No dia 07 de setembro de 1993 o eleitorado definirá  através de plebiscito  a forma (rep 'ublica ou monarquia constitucional) e o sistema de governo (parlamentarismo ou presidencialismo) que devem vigorar no País." Initially  the parliament intended to submit only one single question to the ballot with the three options Monarchy  Presidential Republic and Parliamentary Republic. But finally it decided to submit two separate questions: one on the form of state and the other on the form of government. Another possibility would have been the Presidential Monarchy.  It is striking that almost one fifth of the votes cast was invalid.

The vote has been set by the King on 6 February 1986 with the approval of the Cortes according to article 92 of the constitution.      Original wording of the question:   'Do you consider accurate that Spain remains member of the Atlantic Alliance under the conditions set by the government?' '¿Considera conveniente para España permanecer en la Alianza Atlántica en los términos acordados por el Govierno de la Nación?'  Conditions: 'The government deems the remaining of Spain as member of the Atlantic Alliance as being a national interest. It has therefore decided to maintain this membership under following conditions:      The participation of Spain in the alliance does not include its incorporation in the NATO military structure.     The prohibition of installing  storing or introducing nuclear weapons on Spanish soil remains effective.     The military presence of the USA in Spain is to be reduced gradually.

A quorum of 2/3 of the electorate was required for the adoption of the Constitution. On the voting day 977 826 enfranchised citizens were registered. However  instead of the necessary 651 884 'yes' votes  only 540 113 (55.24% of voters) 'yes' votes were cast. Almost 300 000 voter registrations were then cancelled by the electoral commission. Consequently  of the 689 928 voters  2/3 (459 952) voted 'yes' and the Constitution was adopted by 78.29% of the electorate. Even though this did not please interim President Doe  he approved the amendments.

Main points:       Parliamentary regime with a ceremonial President     One chamber system      Prime Minister holds a veto against Parliament  but can be overruled by a 2/3 majority     Country to be renamed Maharlika     Branches of foreign firms must have at least 60% local control       Temporary reglementations:       Constituent Assembly functions as Parliament     Incumbent President to remain in office pending further notice; holds office of Prime Minister as well     Marcial law to remain effective pending further notice (Decrees  President can dismiss judges)     Indefinite transitional period for the President  On 1 December 1972 Marcos announced the plebiscite for 15 January  only to postpone it on 24 December  and reschedule it for the period between 19 February and 5 March. On 2 January he announced the vote would be held in the Baranyans (neighborhood centers) and that there would be two other issues besides the Constitution. The actual plebiscite - to be held anonymously with ballot boxes - was cancelled on 7 January. After the vote in the 35 000 Baranyans  with the minimum voting age being 15 years  the new Constitution became effective on 17 January  before the Senate meeting of 22 January (following the older text) could take place. Marcos then dissolved the Senate by decree. On which ballot questions the Barangays finally voted remained ambiguous. On 10 January 5 questions were presented  whereas on 11 January  as the ballot took place  further 6 questions were added:      Are you in favour of the New Society?     Are you in favour for the reforms under martial law?     Shall the Congress meet anew?     Shall the plebiscite take place on a subsequent date?     Do you agree with President Marcos' administration?     Shall the neighbourhood centers as foundation of the government decide on questions of important national impact?     Are you in favour of the new Constitution?     Shall a plebiscite be held on the approval of the new Constitution?     Shall the elections  due in November 1973  be held according to the 1935 Constitution?     If the elections are not to take place  when shall they be held instead?     Shall martial law continue to remain effective?  According to the sources  the vote was held only on questions 7  8 and 9. After the vote in the 35 000 Barangays (being held from 10 to 15 January) with suffrage as of 15 years of age  the President brought the new Constitution into force by Proclamation No. 1102 on 17 January  even before the Senate was able to convene on 22 January 1973 according to the old Constitution.

The mandate was a Type C: sparsely populated areas with few possibilites of gaining autonomy that could be more or less administered as a Nation-State. In 1946 the UN intended to assume the responsibility for the administration of the League of Nations mandates  and demanded that South Africa submit the region to the UN. South Africa wished to integrate South West Africa into its own territory and accepted six delegates sent by the white population of South West Africa in 1949 within the Parliament of Cape Town. In 1967 the UN annulled South Africa's mandate and recognises SWAPO as the sole legitimate representative of South West Africa  renamed Namibia in 1968. The white population had always been for annexation to South Africa. On 8 May 1946 its local Parliament demanded annexation  while the South African authorities held the Native Referendum in which they invited black community leaders (chiefs  elders  etc) to sign a petition for the annexation to South Africa. The issue was formulated as follows:  'We  the undersigned  Chiefs  Headmen or Board Members of the people of the [________] tribe  who live in the [________] Reserve in this mandated Territory of South West Africa  acting with full authority of the people of the tribe of the [________] Reserve  wish to say that we have heard the people of the world are talking about the administration of these countries such as ours and that the administration of these countries may be changed.

Sihaouk remained King  though under Japanese supervision. On 10 August his son Ngoc Thanh ousted President Ung Huy and attempted to legitimise his actions via a plebiscite. On 15 October he was arrested by the newly arrived French troops. Whether the plebiscite really deserved the term is questionable. Ngoc Thanh sent a list of questions to the Governors of the provinces  and presumably received as many votes in return as there were men between the ages of 18 and 60 in the respective provinces. One of his questions was:  'Do you wish to be as free as Jayavarman with the temples of Angkor Wat?'

The law regulated the citizenship of Jews  Germans  Russians and other minorities as well as stateless Latvians. Accordingly  members of these ethnic groups had to have resided in Latvia at least since 1925 and half a year before the World War. The referendum was mainly targeted at the Jews. The German Baltic party supported the farmers party to topple the government and so as to hinder them from supporting the referendum. However  the necessary majority was not reached. The Saeima rejected the referendum on 4 November 1927. As the turnout of 50% of the electorate (art. 74  version before 1933) was not reached  the law remained effective. The other parties boycotted the vote. The adoption required the majority of the votes cast. ,"State organisation | Legal system | Citizenship",21.68,,0,0,no,

2457,Country,Free State of Fiume (1920-1924),hr011919,1919-12-18,Disempowerment of Gabriele D'Annunzio and his troops,,,,,,,,,,,Not known,Not known,Not known,Not known,Not known,Not known,Not known,,,none,,,,,,Plebiscite  ad hoc,,,,The Austro-Hungarian Monarchy broke down at the end of October 1918. Croatia declared independence on 29 October and the last townmajor of Fiume surrendered to the Croatian Government. At the same time an Italian 'Consiglio Nazionale' was established to accede Fiume to Italy. On 30 October the Consiglio held a demonstration among the supporters of the accession  known as 'plebiscito del XXX ottobre 1918'. An allied occupation consequently took place. At the command of Gabriele D'Annunzio partisans occupied the city on 12 September 1919  and he declared himself Commander. On 26 October the election of a new Consiglio Nazionale took place. It was called a 'plebiscito' as the only subject was 'accession: yes or no'. The Italian government favoured regular troops instead of partisans and proposed a 'modus vivendi' on 23 November which postponed the accession and replaced D'Annunzio's partisans by the regular army:   'Il Governo Italiano  riaffermando il diritto della cittá italiana di Fiume di decidere dei propri destini  prende atto del voto solenne nuovamente espresso dalla cittá di Fiume di decidere dei propri destini  prende atto del voto solenne nuovamente espresso dalla cittá di Fiume  a mezzo dei suoi legittimi rappresentanti  il 26 ottobre 1919 riservandosi di accoglierlo allorché tale accoglimento non constituirá piú insuperabile ostacolo al conseguimento dei frutti della vittoria e grave pericolo per la pace del mondo e per la esistenza della Patria. Intanto il Governo Italiano é disposto ad aiutare direttamente la cittá di Fiume a rimettersi nelle condizioni normali di vita  indispensabili all' esistenza e alla prosperitá sua e della popolazione del suo retroterra. All' uopo addiverrá immediatamente alle sistemazione della valuta fiumana ed agevolerá la immediata ripresa di attivitá del porto di Fiume in regime di porto franco. Il Governo Italiano si impegna solennemente:           a non consentire o tollerare che mai i diritti sovrani della citá di Fiume e la sua indipendenza siano comunque diminuiti e violati;               a non aderire od accogliere  in nessun caso  soluzioni della questione che separassero comunque Fiume ed il suo territorio da quello della madre Patria;               ad occupare  frattanto  ed a garantire l' integritá di Fiume ed il suo territorio con truppe regolari italiane ed a rispettare quelle proprie milizie che la cittá credesse costituirsi;               a far ricognoscere l' autoritá sovrana cittadina di Fiume designando  presso di essa  un proprio delegato  con l' intento preciso di facilitare i suoi rapporti con l' autoritá del Regno'        The Consiglio approved the proposal on 15 December but the partisans and some citizens protested against it. D' Annunzio alligned himself with the opponents and called for a referendum. This was decided by the Consiglio on 17 December.           Ballot question:        'E da accogliersi la proposta del governo italiano dichiarata accettabile dal Consiglio Nazionale nella seduta del 15 dicembre 1919  sciogliendo Gabriele D' Annunzio e i suoi legionari dal giuramento di tenere Fiume fino a che l' annessione non sia decretata ed attuata? L' elettore che accetta il deliberato del Consiglio nazionale e quindi la proposta del Governo vota con un 'sí'. L' elettore che respinge tale deliberato e con esso la proposta del Governo vota con un 'no'.'  First results showed clear approval  whereupon some of the polling stations were stormed. D' Annunzio interrupted the vote count and questioned the legality of the vote because the Consiglio had already made a decision. Shortly afterwards he signed the 'Modus vivendi'. In the end the referendum votes were not counted. After the Treaty of Rapallo  Fiume became a Free State in January 1921 and was acceded to Italy by the Treaty of Rome in 1924. After World War II it was acceeded to Yugoslavia as 'Rijeka'   then became part of Croatia in 1991.,"State organisation | Institutions | Government, administration",0,,0,0,Not known,

On 9 January 1919 a Republic was proclaimed at short notice but the resignation of Grand Duchess Marie-Adelheid on 15 January  who had been accused of association with Germany  caused the breakdown of the republican movement. Her sister Charlotte became Grand Duchess after Marie-Adelheid resigned.

Subsequently it assigned the Government to prepare a second ballot on the economic orientation  however the vote was only consultative.

President Roye had the votes counted and approved the adoption but Parliament reclaimed the ballot papers  due to its responsibility for counting. It decided to reject the proposal  since the President was not authorised to count the votes. Elections took place in May 1871 despite resistance by Roye.

José Maria Medina was elected President on 15 February 1864. On 9 April 1865 he had elected a constituent assembly  which adopted a new constitution on 18 September:      For the first time Honduras is designated as Republic     Congress of one chamber     Presidential term of 4 years with no reeligibility  The constituent assembly elected Medina interim president  while the election has been approved by the people on 1 December. In order to be reelected  Medina called a new constituent assembly  which voted in Medina's reeligibility and had him elected President. After protests by the opposition  Medina decided to set an open popular vote and consequently the Congress confirmed him as President. In 1872 Medina was expelled from power by a riot of the liberals. Gaining political power was not a very sophisticated process in the nineteenth century and Honduran-style elections were corrupt. Few Hondurans had the vote as eligible voters had to be male  21 years of age  and literate.

In battle against the rebels President Báez ran into large debt  so he decided to sell the Peninsula of Samará for US$1.1 million to the USA. At the same time US President Grant wanted to annex the Republic as a territory. Two treaties were signed on 29 November 1869 after long negotiations. According to the first Treaty  the Republic was supposed to be annexed to the USA for US$1.5 million persuant to an 'explicit declaration of the people's will'. According to the second Treaty  the Peninsula of Samará was supposed to be leased for 99 years for a price of US$147 229.91 to the US government. President Báez set a plebiscite for 16 February in the form of entry into an empty register  in order to avoid blank or void votes. The 11 'no' votes were entered to make the result more believable. After long negotiations back and forth  the US Senate rejected the annexation on 19 June 1871 by 28:28.

The US Senate rejected the Treaty in 1870 and a second treaty was rejected by the Danish Parliament in 1902. The Islands  including St.Croix  were finally sold in 1917 for US$25 million. In 1916 an unofficial referendum was held. All male citizens had the right to vote  including blacks.

However the newly elected Congress  who were opposed to the increasing power of the President  referred to articles 40 and 127 of the 1857 Constitution which provided for a purely representative system and empowered only Congress to make constitutional amendments. The re-elected Juárez struck a compromise and explained that the vote was scheduled merely due to the extraordinary circumstances. On 13 December Congress let the matter rest with a reprimand. Juárez accordingly did not have the votes counted.      From the decree:   'Articulo 90: En el acto de votar los ciudadanos  para nombrar electores en las elecciones primarias  expresarán además su voluntad acerca de si podrá el próximo Congreso de la Unión  sin necesidad de observar los requisitos establecidos en el artículo 127 de la Constitución Federal  reformarla o adicionar la Carta Magna en los siguientes puntos:                Que el Poder Legislativo de la federación se deposite en dos Cámaras  fijándose y distribuyéndose entre ellas sus atribuciones.         Que el Presidente de la República tenga facultad de poner veto suspensivo a las primeras resoluciones del Poder Legislativo para que no se puedan reproducir  sino por dos tercios de votos de la Cámara o Cámaras en que se deposite el Poder Legislativo.

On March 15  1805 the state council submitted its draft to parliament  which approved of it on March 20.

But Napoleon was dissatisfied and therefore after deliberations with the National Council  second Consul Cambacérès enforced - unauthorized - an unconstitutional popular vote on Napoleon's Consulate for life. The Tribunal and the Corps législatif submitted to the vote on 24th Floreal.      Ballot question:   'Napoléon Bonaparte sera-t-il consul à vie?'

Excluded from suffrage were domestic servants  people dependent on social welfare  not working citizens  bankrupt citizens etc. The votes of those people who did not cast a vote  were counted as yes (as was the case in the Helvetic Republic of 1802)  with good reason since the submittal would have been rejected otherwise.

By decree Napoleon enacted a new constitution on 22nd Frimaire VIII (13 December 1799) which became effective on 4th Nivôse VIII (25 December 1799).

Napoleon put the constitution into force on 4th Nivôse VIII (25 December 1799)  even before the final result has been announced on 18th Pluviôse VIII (7 February 1800).

According to the old law there was no census suffrage  just as the first town meetins elected the new electoral colleges  which appointed the new Corps législatif (20th - 29th Vendémiaire). In a second decree of 5th Fructidor and an additional one of 13th (30 August) the convention scheduled a second popular vote  which was supposed to take place contemporaneously to the first one. In case of adoption of the first proposal  the town meeting appoints 500 out of the 750 members of the convention who shall constitute the new Conseil des Cinq-Cents (see hereto the plebiscite concerning the proposal 2). The counting was conducted by the Comité des décrets. Especially the second proposal caused confusion or rejection. In many cases the town meetings considered that the election of two third could easily be conducted or that the votes cast regarding the constitution proposal decided on the two thirds of the convention as well. Consequently the Comité des décrets declared many of the decisions taken by the town meetings invalid  especially the vote from Paris  where this sanction encountered great opposition. Therefore the turnout was lower than the one regarding the vote on the constitution. On 1st Vendémiaire IV  the first day of the Year IV and even before the time limit for the town meeting expired  the convention brought the constitution into force. The spreadsheet of 6th Vendémiaire III (28 September 1795) is the only official compilation of the results. As more precise examinations by the single departments revealed  the result is by far not complete. In fact there should be counted about 1.3 million of yes votes but there is no precise counting of all town meetings. ,"State organisation | Political system | Constitution",0,1107368,95.49,4.51,yes,

2695,Country,France (1792-1804),fr031793,1793-08-04,Montagnarde Constitution,,,,,,,,,,,6000000,,1869004,1326,1065,1714266,12766,,,none,,,,,,Plebiscite  ad hoc,,,, After the proclamation of the Republic on 22 September 1792 the National Assembly decided to suggest a democratic constitution and to submit the elaborated draft to the people as sovereign. On 24 June 1793 the National Assembly adopted the constitution and enacted a decree on 27 June  stipulating that a town meeting had to decide within 8 days on the approval or the rejection of the constitutional draft. In Paris the vote was held between 2 and 4 July  whereas in the vast part of the country votings took place between 14 and 28 July and if at all  in regions of Civil War (e.g. Vendée) later. The last town meeting was held on 4 April 1798 and in total 280 town meetings were not held at all. As from 10 August 1792 all men over 21 years of age  being resident in the canton for 6 months and not living in the same dwelling as domestic worker  were enfranchised to vote. The National Assembly appointed a Commission of Six on 9 July 1793 and assigned it to monitore the counting. The intention was to bring the constitution into effect on 10 August during the Federation Holiday but the voting results arrived only slowly.  A first interim report of 20 August amounted to 1 784 377 yes and 11 531 no votes out of 4 561 of in total 5 076 cantons; A second of 20 January 1974 1 801 918 yes and 11 610 no out of 4 652 cantons. Due to the Vendémiaire riot and the reign of terror the constitution never entered into force nor has an official result been announced. Normally the town meetings were held open whereas the voters could choose to cast their vote written or orally. The counting of the result was nearly impossible since in the first place not all town meetings convened and second of all due to the unambiguity of the voting mode. Many town meetings resulted in an 'unanimous approval' without any other numerical indications  others linked their approval with conditions and desired additions to the constitution. The total number of yes votes might therefore very well be even higher.      Main issues:       Corps législatif consisting of about 500 members (one per 40 000 inhabitants) with a one year term of office     Conseil exécutif consisting of 24 members  elected by the Corps législatif     Warranty of personal rights     Universal male suffrage over 21 years of age and residency for more than 6 months within the same canton     Soldiers not enfranchised     Parliamentary plebiscite (article 30)     Optional legislative referendum: 1/10 of town meeting in half of the departments within 40 days (articles 59  60)     Excluded from vote are administration  police and security issues (article 32)     Calling of a constituent assembly  quotas as above (articles 115 - 117)     The Caveats refer to national debts and the redemption of assignats ,"State organisation | Political system | Constitution",31.15,1727032,99.26,0.74,yes,
